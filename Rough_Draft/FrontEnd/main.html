		<h2>Visual Cryptography</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Visual Cryptography</b> is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information to be encrypted.
			One such technique is where the image is broken into <b>n</b> shares.
			Decryption is performed by overlaying all the shares.
			If any of the shares are missing then descryption is not possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this project the image is split into two images. Each compoent image has a pair of pixel for every pixel in the original image. If the original pixel was white then a matching pair of black/white pixel are sent to both images.
			If the original pixel was black than a complementary pair of pixels are sent
			to the images.

		<h2>Prevention of phishing attacks in Voting System using Visual Cryptography</h2>
		<p>
			Voting system using Visual Cryptography <b>(VC)</b> aims at proving a facility to cast vote for critical and confidential internal corporate decisions.
			It has the flexibility to allow casting of vote from any remote place.
			The election is held in full confidentiality by only allowing the voter to vote for any candidate only if he/she logs into the system by entering the correct password which is genereated by merging two shares using the VC scheme.
			One share is sent to the voter through e-mail before the election while the other share will only be available in the voting system for his/her login <i>during</i> the election.
